Description: Provides methodology to analyze cells that move in a two- or three-dimensional
	space. Available measures include displacement, confinement ratio, autocorrelation,
	straightness, turning angle, and fractal dimension. Measures can be applied to entire tracks,
	steps, or subtracks with varying length. While the methodology has been developed for
	cell trajectory analysis, it is applicable to anything that moves including animals,
	people, or vehicles.
